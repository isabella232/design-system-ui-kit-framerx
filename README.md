This UI Kit is a collection of FramerX components of [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/). The react component base is taken from [Salesforce' Lightning Design System for React](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/). The thousands of customers and partners who build applications on the Salesforce platform can use these resources to quickly visualize and test designs before they're implemented in their Salesforce organizations.

You can use this library by installing the package in FramerX.

## Getting Started

**Welcome to the Winter '19 Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) FramerX UI Kit**

The Salesforce UX team has made optimizations with this FramerX Library so you can more efficiently create Salesforce Lightning interfaces. In the instructions below, weâ€™ll cover the basics and some tips for you to get started.

### Usage Notes

<!-- Some components, like the Accordion, need to include certain values to make it work correctly. For example, the Accordion will need a `.json` file with data that will be rendered.

The accordion can accept a `.json` file that has the following format:

```
items: [
      {
        id: "1",
        summary: "Accordion Summary",
        details: "Accordion details - A"
      },
      {
        id: "2",
        summary: "Accordion Summary",
        details: "Accordion details - B"
      },
      {
        id: "3",
        summary: "Accordion Summary",
        details: "Accordion details - C"
      }
    ]
```

An example file can be found under `extra/accordion.json`. -->
